# AvitoTestTask
The application consists of a single screen with a list. The application downloads a list of data in JSON format from the Internet via [a link](https://run.mocky.io/v3/1d1cb4ec-73db-4762-8c4b-0b8aa3cecd4c). To complete the test task, it was necessary to parse this data and display it in the list.
